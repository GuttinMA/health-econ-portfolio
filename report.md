# Summary Report: Reducing Elective Surgery Cancellations â€“ Quality Improvement Project

## 1. Background

High same-day cancellation rates in the Major Operating Room (OR) were causing inefficiencies, resource waste, and increased waiting times. The cancellation rate hovered around 17.5%, affecting patient satisfaction, surgical output, and staff morale.

## 2. Methods

We implemented a structured Quality Improvement Project (QIP) using the Model for Improvement and PDSA cycles. Core strategies included:

- Creating a multidisciplinary QI team
- Designing a standardized Excel dashboard for daily data collection
- Introducing a cancellation reporting and feedback system
- Engaging hospital leadership and external stakeholders
- Revising OR protocols, scheduling, and communication workflows

## 3. Results

Key outcomes included:

- Cancellation rate dropped from 17.5% to **7.2%**
- OR productivity improved across all surgical departments
- Visualized progress using run charts and cancellation-by-department summaries
- Multidisciplinary collaboration and team accountability increased

## 4. Lessons Learned

- Simple tools like Excel and daily reporting can drive major changes when consistently applied.
- Multidisciplinary communication is critical to reducing avoidable cancellations.
- Visual feedback (charts, dashboards) increases awareness and accountability.

## 5. Takeaways

This project demonstrates my ability to apply structured improvement methods in real healthcare settings. It highlights my:

- Analytical mindset (designing dashboards and tracking indicators)
- Leadership and coordination across teams
- Focus on data-driven decision-making and sustainable change

The QIP approach can be adapted to any surgical or clinical workflow aiming to improve outcomes, reduce waste, or enhance efficiency.
